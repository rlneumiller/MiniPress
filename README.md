# MiniPress

## Printing Instructions:
* Utilize the included Prusa Slicer (3mf) file (uses "Normal" 0.2mm layer height).

OR
* Orientation: Place flat on the print bed, except for the screw model, which should be printed upright.
* Supports: Supports and brims are generally not needed.
* Infill: A moderate infill (20-30%) is recommended for strength and durability.
For a final print you may also want to decrease layer height (increases print time exponentially).
